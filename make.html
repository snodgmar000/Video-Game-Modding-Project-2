    </header>
    <p>Video Game modding is where you take a video game and change/add on to it's coding and assets to make it your own or to have a different experience and they be as simple as a UI change or be as complicated as a whole game</p>
    <p>Modding can be as easy as clicking a button but it can be as hard as downloading software to inject and compile mod files and it can depend on what game your trying to mod</p>
    <p>Thankfully lots of mods now have one click installs now (if the software was made by the community like HedgeModManager or the developers like the MarrowSDK by Stress Level Zero)</p>
